paragraph= 'The best home espresso machines can help you get your espresso, Americano, latte or cappuccino fix right in the comfort of your own kitchen. Traditional coffee shop machines can seem like huge, unknowable beasts, but home espresso machines can have you pulling a shot with a good "crema" (the creamy, light-colored surface of an espresso) in no time. Some espresso makers will grind beans for you, pack the grounds and make your cup with just the push of a button, while others will require you to learn to fill a hopper (known as a portafilter) with grounds and tamp them (which means to compress the grounds into a puck so the hot, pressurized water can extract a lot of flavor as it passes through quickly).'
